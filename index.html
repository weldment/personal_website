    <p>I am a welding engineer living in New Mexico. I have way too many hobbies and interests inluding anything outdoors, spending time with my wife and son, travel, personal improvement, and learning how things work and basically anything new.</p>
    <p>My goal with this website is to document my thoughts and in a variety of aspects primarily for myself but also for anyone else that may be interested.</p>
    <h3>What I am Working On</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Productivity</li>
        <li>Intentionality and Discipline</li>
        <li>Simplicity and Balance</li>
        <li>Personal Effectiveness and Capability</li>
        <li>Business Skills and Web Development</li>
        <li>Clarity</li>
        <li>Financial Independence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would also like to make this a permanent record of who I am as well that will live on after me even in case someone is ever curious about me. I havent even figured out how to do that yet but it is an interesting idea to me.</p>
